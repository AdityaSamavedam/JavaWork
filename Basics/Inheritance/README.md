## Basic Inheritance
* Define a class Animal with attributes name and age. Create a subclass Dog that adds an attribute breed. Implement appropriate constructors and methods to demonstrate inheritance. Write a main method to create an instance of Dog and display its attributes.

## Method Overriding:
* Create a superclass Shape with a method area(). Define two subclasses: Circle and Rectangle, each implementing their own version of area(). Write a main method that creates instances of both subclasses and prints their area.

## Constructor Chaining in Inheritance: 
* Implement a class hierarchy where Vehicle is the superclass, and Car and Truck are subclasses. Both subclasses should have additional attributes. Use constructor chaining to initialize attributes in a main method.

## Super Keyword:
 * Create a superclass Person with attributes name and age. Create a subclass Student that adds a major attribute. Use the super keyword to access the superclass constructor. Write a main method to create instances of both classes and display their information

## Dynamic Method Dispatch:
* Implement a class hierarchy with a superclass Bird and subclasses Sparrow and Eagle. Override a method makeSound() in each subclass. Write a main method that creates an array of Bird references and demonstrates dynamic method dispatch by calling makeSound().
