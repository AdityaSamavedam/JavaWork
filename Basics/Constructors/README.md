# üèóÔ∏è Create Objects Using a Constructor Function

* As a developer, I want to create new objects using a constructor function.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the constructor function is named `Developer()` and it takes in two parameters, `name` and `tech`.

* It's done when the parameters are passed into the object's keys as their values.

* It's done when the object's third key is a method called `introduction()` that prints a message in the console, introducing a developer's `name` and what `tech` they like.

* It's done when I create a new object using the `Developer()` constructor with a `name` and `tech` of my choice.

* It's done when the introduction of my new object is printed in the console.


# Create a class Employee with attributes name, id, and department. Implement a constructor that takes all three parameters and another that takes only name and id, using constructor chaining. Write a main method to test both constructors.

# Create a class Counter that has a static variable to count the number of instances created. Implement a constructor that increments this static variable each time an instance is created. Write a main method to create multiple instances and print the count.

# Define a class ImmutablePoint with final attributes x and y. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes. Demonstrate that once an instance is created, its values cannot be changed.

# Write a class Student with attributes name and age. Implement a constructor that checks if the age is negative and throws an exception if it is. Write a main method to test this behavior.

# Create a class House with attributes like color, size, and type. Implement a builder pattern to create an instance of House with optional attributes. Provide a main method that demonstrates creating a House object using the builder.
